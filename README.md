# Notes
*Asp.Net CORE 3.1 and React* :godmode:



It's my first experience with React-part and some things can look very strange.

## How to try the examples :
- Download or Clone files form *github*
- In folder webnote.react open terminal and input `npm install` then `npm start`
- After, `cd to WebNote` (asp.net core api - solution) and run in cmd `dotnet run` to using DataBase 

## Functionalities :
1. We can create new Notes and one stored in DB.
2. Deleted/Changed our Notes.
3. Also, Routes has checking to validate route through SPA.
3. Architecture of project (features)
   - web api
   - Repository pattern
   - EF
   - Independent layers

## End-To-End Testing with Cypress

Now you need open Cypress from your project root one of the following ways:

- `./node_modules/.bin/cypress open`

Or by using npx

- `npx cypress open`
